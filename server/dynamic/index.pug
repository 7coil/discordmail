								| By viewing this E-Mail you will have succeeded in Step 1 of the DiscordMail tutorial.
								br
								br
								| Step 2: Try sending an E-Mail to a friend of yours.
								br
								code dmail send yourfriend@example.com 'Hello!' I sent an E-Mail from Discord, isn't that cool?
								br
								|Tip! You can attach a single file while sending the message to send the attachment in Discord!
								br
								br
								| Step 3: Explore!
								br
								| Because DiscordMail is just a normal E-Mail client, you can use your DiscordMail account anywhere where you can insert an E-Mail. If E-Mails don't come out right in Discord, you can click the embed URL to open the original HTML version. Try it out on this E-Mail!
